Hi everyone! This is Renso. "pc_performance" is my first project for measuring the performance of my laptop. 
I gather basic information to collect, transform, and export data for later analysis. 
For this program, I used the Python library "psutil" to obtain all the necessary information. 
This project started with me wondering about the capabilities of my laptop (i5 4200M, 16GB of RAM, and a 240GB SSD), keeping in mind my desire to delve deeper into Data Analysis and AI.
So far, I have developed this program to gather data and learn Python on my own.
